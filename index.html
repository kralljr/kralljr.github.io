			    <ul><li><em>Abstract:</em> Short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity in epidemiologic studies. PM is generated by many sources including traffic, coal combustion, and biomass burning, and the effects of PM on human health may vary depending on the combination of sources that generate PM.  Determining whether some types of PM sources are more toxic than others is critical to understanding how PM impacts human health and to designing control strategies for reducing PM levels.  In most time series studies, concentrations of PM by source type are not directly observed and must be inferred from concentrations of PM constituents observed at ambient monitors.  Performing multisite time series studies of PM sources is challenging because PM source types are latent quantities that are frequently estimated separately for each monitor.  Currently, ad hoc or manual approaches are applied to match estimated source types between monitors for multisite studies, but these methods are not easily reproducible and are not practical for large, regional studies.  We developed SHARE, a novel principal component analysis approach that identifies shared features in PM data across a region to facilitate reproducible, multisite studies of PM sources. Using data from 2000-2010 for 63 counties in the northeastern US, we estimated regional-level associations between short-term exposure to major types of PM sources and cardiovascular hospitalizations.</li></ul>

			    <ul><li><em>Abstract:</em> Epidemiologic studies have been critical for estimating associations between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollution and adverse health outcomes. Because total PM mass is a temporally and spatially varying mixture of constituents with different physical and chemical properties, recent studies have aimed to determine the constituents of PM most associated with mortality and morbidity. Studies have estimated associations between PM constituents and health using the same statistical methods as in studies of PM mass and other pollutants. However, these approaches may not be sufficient to address challenges specific to studies of PM constituents, namely assigning exposure, disentangling health effects, and handling measurement error. We reviewed epidemiologic studies of PM constituents and health and describe the statistical methods typically applied to address these challenges. In addition, we highlight areas where further development and application of statistical methods could improve estimation of associations between PM constituents and adverse health outcomes.</li> </ul>

			    <ul><li> <em> Abstract:</em> Short-term exposure to total ambient PM2.5 mass has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Determining which sources of PM2.5 are most toxic can help guide regulation of PM2.5. However, estimation of source-specific PM2.5 for use in multicity studies is difficult because sources are not generally directly measured and the chemical compositions of source emissions vary between cities. We aimed to identify sources of ambient PM2.5 with similar chemical composition across multiple cities and to estimate associations between PM2.5 from these sources and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory diseases.  We used source apportionment to estimate daily mass concentrations of PM2.5 by source type for four US cities. For sources similar in chemical composition between cities, we applied Poisson time-series regression models to estimate associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 from selected sources and respiratory disease ED visits.  We found PM2.5 from mobile sources, biomass burning, and dust was similar in chemical composition between cities, but PM2.5 from coal combustion and metal sources varied across cities. We found evidence of positive associations of ED visits for respiratory disease with PM2.5 from biomass burning and little evidence of associations with PM2.5 from dust. Associations with PM2.5 from mobile sources were not consistent across cities. We introduced an approach for comparing chemical compositions of source-apportioned PM2.5 across cities and used this approach to conduct one of the first multicity studies of sources of PM2.5 and ED visits.</li></ul>
