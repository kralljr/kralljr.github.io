        <li><strong> Krall JR</strong>, Hackstadt AJ, Peng RD. A method to identify regional particulate matter sources and their associations with cardiovascular hospitalizations    </li>
        <ul><li><em>Abstract:</em> Conducting multisite epidemiologic studies of sources of particulate matter (PM) air pollution is challenging because sources of PM are unobserved and are frequently estimated at each ambient pollution monitor.   Ad hoc or manual approaches are commonly applied to match estimated source types between monitors for multisite studies, but these methods are not easily reproducible and are not practical for large, regional studies.  Other existing approaches assume the sources that generate PM do not vary between monitors, an assumption that is frequently violated in large multisite studies.  Multisite studies of PM sources and adverse health outcomes are critical to understanding how PM impacts human health and to designing control strategies for reducing PM concentrations.  We developed SHARE, a novel population-level decomposition method that facilitates reproducible, multisite epidemiologic studies of PM sources while allowing source types to vary between monitors. Using data from 2000-2010 for 63 counties in the northeastern US, we estimated regional-level associations between short-term exposure to major types of PM sources and cardiovascular hospitalizations.</li></ul>

        <ul><li> <em> Abstract:</em> Short-term exposure to total ambient PM2.5 mass has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Determining which sources of PM2.5 are most toxic can help guide regulation of PM2.5. However, estimation of source-specific PM2.5 for use in multicity studies is difficult because sources are not generally directly measured and the chemical compositions of source emissions vary between cities. We aimed to identify sources of ambient PM2.5 with similar chemical composition across multiple cities and to estimate associations between PM2.5 from these sources and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory diseases.  We used source apportionment to estimate daily mass concentrations of PM2.5 by source type for four US cities. For sources similar in chemical composition between cities, we applied Poisson time-series regression models to estimate associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 from selected sources and respiratory disease ED visits.  We found PM2.5 from mobile sources, biomass burning, and dust was similar in chemical composition between cities, but PM2.5 from coal combustion and metal sources varied across cities. We found evidence of positive associations of ED visits for respiratory disease with PM2.5 from biomass burning and little evidence of associations with PM2.5 from dust. Associations with PM2.5 from mobile sources were not consistent across cities. We introduced an approach for comparing chemical compositions of source-apportioned PM2.5 across cities and used this approach to conduct one of the first multicity studies of sources of PM2.5 and ED visits.</li></ul>
