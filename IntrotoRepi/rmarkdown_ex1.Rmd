This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** *knitr* button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Header
## Subheader
### Subsubheader


- List item 1
- List item 2
    - Sublist item 1
    - Sublist item 2
- List item 3

1. List item 1
2. List item 2
3. List item 3

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```


You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

The mean of distance is `r mean(cars$dist)`.  The mean speed is `r mean(cars$speed)`.


```{r}
library(dplyr)
cars <- filter(cars, dist < 100)
```

The mean of distance is `r mean(cars$dist)`.  The mean speed is `r mean(cars$speed)`.  You need to load the dplyr package using `library(dplyr)`.
